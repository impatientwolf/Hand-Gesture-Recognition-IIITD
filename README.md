#Abstract:

In todayâ€™s world, computer technology has grown a lot,
and to cope up with it we need a more natural way of interacting
with computers. The invention of the keyboard and mouse has
helped a lot but there are still some situations where we need a
more natural way of interaction. Advancement in Human
Interaction technology brings a very positive impact in our society
as it becomes easy for individuals to interact with computers.
Human beings are using a wider range of hand gestures to
communicate with each other as it is a mode of non-verbal yet
powerful interaction medium.
Also, hand gestures provide the most originative and intuitive and
more usual way to interact with computers as compared to other
body parts.
In this paper we made a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
based model to recognise the static hand gesture images and, with
that we have extensively compared our model with several
Machine Learning models including SVM,Decision Tree , Naive
Bayes, random forest.
